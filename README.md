## Welcome. My name is Nate.

### 🔭 I’m a [#vetswhocode](https://vetswhocode.io/) coding bootcamp graduate. <br>
🌞 By day, I work as a research & development and QA/QC chemist. <br>
🌜 By night and early morning, I study to understand the most popular languages and frameworks and apply this knowledge by building projects and writing tutorials. <br>

My most recent fullstack project is a drag and drop [dimensional analysis calculator](https://dimensional-analysis-app.netlify.app/) This project was built with GatsbyJS, Apollo, Express, Node, MongoDB, and GraphQL. The backend is hosted by Heroku and the front end is deployed with Netlify.

I built both of the projects below from scratch to really understand the basics of semantic HTML, CSS and Responsive Web Design, SEO, and everything else that comes from building a website from scratch.
