# Welcome. My name is Nate.

### 🔭 I’m a recent [#vetswhocode](https://vetswhocode.io/) coding bootcamp graduate. <br>
#### 🌞 By day, I work as a research & development and QA/QC chemist. <br>
#### 🌜 By night and early morning, I study to understand the most popular languages and frameworks and apply this knowledge building projects. <br>

My most recent fullstack project is a drag and drop [dimensional analysis calculator](https://dimensional-analysis-app.netlify.app/) This project was built with GatsbyJS, Apollo, Express, Node, MongoDB, and GraphQL. The backend is hosted by Heroku and the front end is deployed with Netlify.

I enjoy creating static content website. I built both of these from scratch to really learn the basics. I'm looking forward to using Hugo or Ghost on my next static content project.
