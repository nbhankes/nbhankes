# My name is Nate.

🔭 I’m a recent [#vetswhocode](https://vetswhocode.io/) coding bootcamp graduate. <br>
🌞 By day, I work as a research & development and QA/QC chemist. <br>
🌜 By night, I study to intimately understand the most popular languages and frameworks and apply this knowledge building projects. <br>
🚀 My goal is to become a professional frontend developer that helps create the future.
