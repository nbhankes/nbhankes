Welcome! My name is Nate.

🔭 I’m a recent [#vetswhocode](https://vetswhocode.io/) coding bootcamp graduate. <br>
🌞 By day, I work as a research & development and QA/QC chemist. <br>
🌜 By night, I study to understand the most popular languages and frameworks intimately and apply this knowledge building projects. <br>
🚀 My goal is to become a professional frontend developer that helps create the future. 

I spend my nights building my proficiency in ↪️ HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Node, React, GraphQL

I'm excited to learn these next ↪️ Python & Rust
